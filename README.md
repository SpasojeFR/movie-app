To run project in movie_proxy run command “node server,js” to run proxy server, and then go in movie and run “npm run start”.

Architecture is structured based on pages (routes) and reusable components. Styling and everything related to that components are stored in its folder. For state management sistem I used context.

If I had more time i would implement chat feature, so users can communicate between themselves and share information about movies.
